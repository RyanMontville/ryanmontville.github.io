                        <p>I'm Ryan, but you probably already knew that since you found my website. I grew up in
                            Cleveland, Ohio and graduated in 2016 with a bachelors in Communication Technologies with a
                            focus on human-computer interaction from The Ohio State University. In my free time I enjoy
                            building DIY projects, <a href="https://ryanmontville.com/reading-list/">reading</a>,
                            volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, and trying new things.</p>

                        <p>In 2015 I was accepted into the Disney College Program internship in Walt Disney World
                            working food & beverage at Columbia Harbour House in the Magic Kingdom. Working for Disney
                            was extremely enjoyable.I became friends with many new people from around the world, I
                            learned many valuable skills, I got to take part in several once-in-a-lifetime events, and
                            made countless unforgettable memories. Everyday brought new and unexpected situations,
                            requiring me to make decisions on the go. Working closely with my team, I strived to keep
                            our location efficient while still creating and delivering those magical experiences to
                            thousands of guests every day.</p>
                        <p>When I first started the internship, I thought working for Disney would be a temporary thing
                            and that I would go back to living in Ohio after the internship ended. I soon realized that
                            I really
                            enjoyed working for Disney and wanted to make a career out of it. I completed a second
                            internship
                            with Disney after I graduated in 2016 working in merchandise in Hollywood Hills in Hollywood
                            Studios, but I enjoyed working there so much, I ended up moving to Florida and working for
                            Disney for the next 7 years. I worked on 8 different different teams across multiple lines
                            of businesses including food & beverage, merchandise and attractions.I started My Adventure
                            Blog at the begining of my first internship to talk about my experience at Disney. If you
                            would like to read more about my time at Disney, <a

                        <p>While working for Disney was enjoyable, I have always been interested in programming,
                            especially
                            creating websites. In 2022 I enrolled in Tech Elevator's national live remote java bootcamp
                            where I
                            learned how to develop dynamic web-based software systems using the Java programming
                            language and platform.</p>
                        <p>Since Tech Elevator I have been contuning to learn new languages such as Python and C#, new
                            frameworks such as React.js and Angular, and exploring things such as AWS and AI
                            fundamentals. I am currently working
                            on getting a Master's degree in Software Engineering from Loyola University Chicago. You can
                            view my coursework <a href="https://ryan-montville.github.io/">here</a>.</p>
