(You can check out his website <a href='https://olympics-better-rankings.vercel.app/' target='_blank'>here</a>). In the comments, several people were saying the countries should be ranked by the total medals won including every athlete on a team, so a team of 4 would add 4 medals to the total instead of 1. After finding a dataset that was more than just the medal totals, I created a database and used Python to calculate the ACTUAL Olympic rankings. My Angular app ranks the countries by the actual medal counts and allows you to expand each country to see all of the medals awarded and how many athletes on the team to add the the total count for that medal. I found the dataset on <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/piterfm/paris-2024-olympic-summer-games' target='_blank'>Kaggle</a> and used <a href='https://flagsapi.com/' target='_blank'>flagsapi.com</a> for the flag images.</p>",

The ascii output is stored in 7 arrays, one for each line of the ascii gallows. It asks the user to guess a letter. If the guess isn't in the word, it adds the guess to a list of wrong guesses and adds a body part to the proper gallows array and prints the gallows again. If the guess is correct, it replaces every underscore in the list where that letter should be.

The bubbles are populated from an array. When the user enters a query, the query is added to the array the app runs through a lot if conditional checks to see if the query includes certain words and if so, executes the corresponding function, and adds the output to the array. Since the app is just checking for certain words, it shouldn't matter if the query is 'current temp' or 'What is the temperature currently?'. The app can give weather info about Current, Today, Tomorrow, Week, Weekend, Hourly, or any day of the week.</p>",

    "description": "<p>While I was enrolled in Tech Elevator, I competed in an ugly website competition against the other students. The purpose of the competition was to develop a better understanding of HTML and CSS and to get us to research and explore web design on our own outside of lecture. I took inspiration from the horrible ugly sites of the 90s. I tried to break every rule I could think of when it comes to designing a good website. I intentionally did not optimize the site for cross-browser or cross-device support so it might not display nicely on your screen. Every element has a CSS transform rotation of a few degrees so nothing is straight or lined up. The font-family, font-size, and color are not consistent across paragraphs. Every element changes the mouse cursor to a different pointer and none relate to the context the cursor is currently over. There are broken image links and pixelated images. Where modern websites use CSS to style most of the page, I tried to use as many .png images as possible to build the UI. I kept on adding more code and useless properties to every element.</p><p>One warning before you click on the link, the background is animated and might be hard to look at for too long, if you click on the STOP sign in the top left corner it will stop the background animation. I have not included any screenshots because this website deserves to be viewed in its full ugliness.</p>",
