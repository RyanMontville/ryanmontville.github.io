I took inspiration from the horrible ugly sites of the 90s. I tried to break every rule I could think of when it comes to designing a good website. I intentionally did not optimize the site for cross-browser or cross-device support so it might not display nicely on your screen. Every element has a CSS transform rotation of a few degrees so nothing is straight or lined up. The font-family, font-size, and color are not consistent across paragraphs. Every element changes the mouse cursor to a different pointer and none relate to the context the cursor is currently over. There are broken image links and pixelated images. Where modern websites use CSS to style most of the page, I tried to use as many .png images as possible to build the UI. I kept on adding more code and useless properties to every element.</p><p>One warning before you click on the link, the background is animated and might be hard to look at for too long, if you click on the STOP sign in the top left corner it will stop the background animation.
