            <p>I'm Ryan, but you probably already knew that since you found my website. I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio
                and went to school at The Ohio State University. I graduated in 2016 with a bachelors in Communication
                Technologies with a focus on human-computer interaction. In my free time I enjoy building DIY projects, <a href="https://ryanmontville.com/reading-list/">reading</a> hanging out
                with my dog Rufus, volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, and trying new things.</p>

                <p>In 2015 I was accepted into the Disney College Program internship in Walt Disney World. I worked on 8
                    different different teams across multiple lines of businesses including food & beverage, merchandise
                    and attractions. Working for Disney was extremely enjoyable.I became friends with many new people
                    from around the world, I learned many valuable skills, I got to take part in several
                    once-in-a-lifetime events, and made countless unforgettable memories. Everyday brought new and
                    unexpected situations, requiring me to make decisions on the go. Working closely with my team, I
                    strived to keep our location efficient while still creating and delivering those magical experiences
                    to thousands of guests every day.</p>
                <p>When I first started the internship, I thought working for Disney would be a temporary thing and that
                    I would go back to living in Ohio after the internship ended. I soon realized that I really enjoyed
                    working for Disney and wanted to make a career out of it. I completed a second internship with
                    Disney after I graduated in 2016, but I enjoyed working there so much, I ended up moving to Florida
                    and working for Disney for the next 7 years.</p>
                <p>When I started my first DCP, I started My Adventure Blog to talk about my experience at Disney. If
                    you would like to read more about my time at Disney, <a

                <p>While working for Disney was enjoyable, I have always been interested in programming, especially
                    creating websites. In 2022 I enrolled in Tech Elevator's national live remote java bootcamp where I
                    learned how to develop dynamic web-based software systems using the Java programming language and platform.</p>
                <p>Since Tech Elevator I have been contuning to learn new languages such as Python and C#, new
                    frameworks such as React.js and Angula, and exploring things such as AWS and AI fundamentals. I am currently working 
                    on getting a Master's degree in Software Engineering from Loyola University Chicago.</p>
